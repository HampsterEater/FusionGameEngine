published at binaryphoenix.com. I've made the project open source
in the hope that somebody, somemwhere may find a use for it.

If you have any questions you can contact me at helios4ever@gmail.com, please
don't ask any questions about bug fixs, updates or similar, as I'll most likely
ignore your email. As stated above, this project is abandonware, I have no intention
of maintaining it in the future.

The source code for this program can be compiled under Visual Studio 2008. Be aware
though there are a lot of bugs, and things still needing to be done. This project
was abandoned, mid development.
